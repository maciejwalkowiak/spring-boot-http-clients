# Spring Boot HTTP Clients

**Spring Boot HTTP Clients** provides zero-boilerplate auto-configuration for `WebClient` and Spring 6 HTTP Interface based HTTP clients in a **Spring Boot** application.

> **Note**
> The project is in the early stage, so expect breaking changes.

Spring 6 introduced a new way to define HTTP clients using interfaces - [HTTP Interfaces](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#rest-http-interface) (introduction video: [üöÄ New in Spring Framework 6: HTTP Interfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1V71peRNn0)).

Right now, setting up an HTTP client requires a bit of boilerplate code:

1. Create a property for the base url. 
2. Create a `WebClient` bean which uses this property
3. Create an `HttpServiceProxyFactory`.

This project aims to simplify this process and provide ease of creating HTTP clients similar to [Spring Cloud OpenFeign](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-openfeign/docs/current/reference/html/).

> **Note**
> It's very likely that Spring Boot will eventually implement its own way to autoconfigure HTTP clients, and this project will become deprecated. Look for updates on this topic here: [#31337](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/31337)

## ü§î How to install

The project is not yet published to Maven Central.
To use it, you must checkout the repository and build locally with `./mvn install`.

Then, add the dependency to `spring-boot-http-clients`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.maciejwalkowiak.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-http-clients</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## ‚ú® How to use

1. Define HTTP clients in `application.yml` or `application.properties` under the prefix `http.clients`:

```yaml
http.clients:
  todo-client:
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
  user-client:
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
```

The client names (in the above example, `todo-client` and `user-client`) are just strings - use anything that makes sense - they are going to be used to construct the `WebClient` bean name.

The above code gets processed by `WebClientsAutoConfiguration`, which creates a bean of type `WebClient` with the name `<client-name>.WebClient`.

2. Define an HTTP client with Spring 6 HTTP Interface, annotate it with `@HttpClient`, and set the client name as the parameter:

```java 
@HttpClient("todo-client")
public interface TodoClient {
    @GetExchange
    List<Todo> get();
}
```

3. That's it! Now you can inject `TodoClient` anywhere in your code üôÉ

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced usage

Autoconfigured `WebClient` instances are the result of calling Spring Boot autoconfigured `WebClient.Builder#build`, which allows defining custom `WebClientCustomizer` that get applied on the `WebClient` beans.

If for any reason you cannot rely on the autoconfigured `WebClient`, but you still want to use autoconfigured HTTP Interface based HTTP client, make sure to create a bean with name `<client-name>.WebClient`, which will be picked up to create an HTTP client.

### Customizing Headers
Default headers can be set in `application.yml` or `application.properties` under the prefix `http.clients.<client-name>.headers` key. 

```yaml
http.clients:
  todo-client:
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
    headers:
      X-My-Header: my-value-x
      Y-My-Header: ${DYNAMIC_VALUE:default-value}
```

### Customizing Cookies
Default cookies can be set in `application.yml` or `application.properties` under the prefix `http.clients.<client-name>.cookies` key.

```yaml
http.clients:
  todo-client:
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
    cookies:
      someCookie: cookie-value
      someDynamicCookie: ${DYNAMIC_VALUE:default-value}
```

### Adding Filters
[Filter functions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/ExchangeFilterFunction.html) can be defined in `application.yml` or `application.properties` under the prefix `http.clients.<client-name>.filters` key.

```yaml
http.clients:
  todo-client:
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
    filters:
      - filterFunction
      - filterFunction2
```
